- New construction algorithm: now the construction is done by completing two steps.
In the first one, hashmaps of group nodes are built independently and stored on disk in ${workdir}/hashmaps.
After, they are merged into a database hashmap.

It makes the peak RAM consumption approximately to be max(proba matrix size, final database size).
